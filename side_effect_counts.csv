These are not all of the possible side effects of zopiclone. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. Interactions Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Especially tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. Zopiclone may increase the effect of the following medicines: Medicines for mental problems (antipsychotics) Medicines for depression Medicines for epilepsy (anticonvulsants) Medicines used in surgery (anaesthetics) Medicines to calm or reduce anxiety or for sleep problems (hypnotics) Medicines for hay fever, rashes or other allergies that can make you sleepy (sedative antihistamines) such as chlorphenamine or promethazine Some medicines for moderate to severe pain (narcotic analgesics) such as codeine, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, pethidine or tramadol The following medicines can increase the chances of you getting side effects when taken with zopiclone. To make this less likely, your doctor may decide to lower your dose of zopiclone: Some antibiotics such as clarithromycin or erythromycin Some medicines for fungal infections such as ketaconazole and itraconazole Ritonavir (a protease inhibitor) - for HIV infections Concomitant use of zopiclone and opioids increases the risk of drowsiness, difficulties breathing, coma and death. Follow your doctor’s dosage recommendations closely. The following medicines can make zopiclone less effective: Some medicines for epilepsy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin Rifampicin (an antibiotic) - for infections St John’s Wort (a herbal medicine) - for mood swings and depression This medication can change the levels of liver enzymes shown up in blood tests. This can mean that your liver is not working properly. If you are going to have a blood test, it is important to tell your doctor that you are taking zopiclone. Pregnancy and breastfeeding Zopiclone is not recommended during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Taking zopiclone during pregnancy may affect your baby. Some studies have shown that there may be an increased risk of cleft lip and palate (sometimes called “harelip”) in the newborn baby. Reduced fetal movement and fetal heart rate variability may occur after taking zopiclone during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. If zopiclone is taken at the end of pregnancy or during labour, your baby may show muscle weakness, a drop in body temperature, difficulty feeding and breathing problems (respiratory depression). If this medicine is taken regularly in late pregnancy, your baby may develop physical dependence and may be at risk of developing withdrawal symptoms such as agitation or shaking. In this case the newborn should be closely monitored during the postnatal period. Do not take zopiclone if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Small amounts of this medication may pass into breast milk. If you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking any medicine.
